I primarily collaborated with Charlie and Valeria for HW 5

Assignment 1

Assignment 1 I did mostly on my own. Valeria was with me while I worked on it, and our conversation about Z-scores and statistics helped me better understand the assignment as I worked through it. I was unable to figure out the final component, using the chi-square, no matter how many websites I went to to understand its usage. This became a recurring theme for this week.

Assignment 2

I primarily worked alone for Assignment 2, using the skeleton notebook as a guide. Again, the chi-square statistic was an insurmountable hill for me, so those elements are incomplete. 

Assignment 3 

Charlie, Valeria and I worked on the data munging together. I was able to develop the plots mostly independently, though Valeria helped me catch a few instances where my x and y values were swapped. Charlie and I worked together to fit the models. Later in the day, I offered guidance on this part to fellow students - Valeria, Matt, and Sarah
