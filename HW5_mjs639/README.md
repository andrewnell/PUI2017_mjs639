I primarily collaborated with Charlie, Valeria, and Sarah for HW 5

Assignment 1

Assignment 1 I did mostly on my own. Valeria was with me while I worked on it, and our conversation about Z-scores and statistics helped me better understand the assignment as I worked through it. I was unable to figure out the final component, using the chi-square, no matter how many websites I went to to understand its usage. This became a recurring theme for this week.

Assignment 2

I primarily worked alone for Assignment 2, using the skeleton notebook as a guide. Again, the chi-square statistic was an insurmountable hill for me, so those elements are incomplete. Sarah was able to provide me with some guidance on the usage of the chi-square to get the plots to where they are now, but I believe I still have errors.

Assignment 3 

Charlie, Valeria and I worked on the data munging together. I was able to develop the plots mostly independently, though Valeria helped me catch a few instances where my x and y values were swapped. Charlie and I worked together to fit the models, and Sarah shared with me a means of normalizing the plots (by dividing both x and y by the population values). Prior to doing this, I was unable to include the US on my plots because it would distort them too significantly.
