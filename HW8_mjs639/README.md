HW 8 

For HW 8 I mapped the average SAT scores from 368 high schools across the boroughs of New York in 2012. I obtained two datasets from NYC Open Data: one providing the SAT scores from 2012, and another providing the precise location of each school. I cleaned and merged the datasets using Python. Once the final dataset was created, I uploaded the csv file into Carto to generate my map (Figure 1). Each dot represents one of the school, and the color (per the legend on the top left of the map) represents the average SAT score.

Figure 1 represents 368 high schools across New York City. The color of each representative dot reflects the average SAT score for 2012. Red dots represent schools with lower scores, green dots represent schools with higher scores, as per the legend on the top left of the map. 


A link to the interactive map is below, and the notebook used to generate my dataset has been uploaded to the repo.
