Assignment #3

For this assignment, I worked alongside Sam Ovenshine, Kent Pan, and Valeria Schiavon. We all worked independently for the most part, but Sam was instrumental in helping me figure out the 'for' loops in the code. Valeria and I also cross-referenced our code at the end. We discovered that, if we used the same values for 'sigma' and 'mu', used the same formula for adjusting the means, and defined our colors the same way, not only was our graph perfectly identical, but the colors used also aligned perfectly. This, to me, was an indication that the results were actually reproducible.

A note on the means: In the prompt, we were instructed to set each of the 50 random arrays so that they all had different means. To me, the simplest way to do this was to adjust the value of 'mu' by some factor of 'i', since each array had a unique value for 'i'. I chose my formula (mu + (10*i)) because I believe it showcased the spread of the data well; it was, however, a purely aesthetic value. I'm not sure if this was the intended outcome, but I hope it is at least an approximation of what we were prompted to do!
