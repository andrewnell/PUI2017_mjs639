HW 6 

For this assignment I worked closely with Kent. We made it to the end working together, and then had some difficulty plotting our log model. I worked on the later stages (specifically fitting the data with a quadratic model) with Sam and Sarah. Sarah also helped me figure out why my regressions were not plotting (there was an extraneous loglog value set)
