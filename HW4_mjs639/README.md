HW 4

Assignment 1

For Assignment 1, I worked alone. I reviewed the experiment set up, and analyzied what data was compiled and how it might inform the hypothesis that was to be tested. I submitted a pull request with my analysis, but have also included a copy here.

Assignment 2

For Assignment 2, I worked alone. This was more challenging than expected, as I do not have a lot of experience parsing through scientific research. Additionally, most of the experiments used multiple types of statistical analysis, and so it was tricky to isolate one specific test for my analysis. I did my best, but am still a bit unsure when it comes to the myriad options for statistical tests and how to classify them properly

Assignment 3

I worked with Charlie Moffett on assignment 3. We went through the cells together, developed our null hypothesis, and inferred the testing methods based on the information provided to us in earlier cells. 

Assignment 4

Assignment 4 was exceptionally challenging for me. I worked with Charlie, Valeria, Davey, and received some insight from Sam on this exercise. I had a very difficult time following cell-by-cell, and ended up spending a lot of time developing incorrect test variables for the Spearman and Pearson's tests. Sam ultimately helped me figure out what was to be tested, and how to get the data formatted properly. I also had some trouble determining what was expected -- the write up in GitHub indicated that we just had to run the tests, but the notebook showed various plots, which ended up confusing me.
