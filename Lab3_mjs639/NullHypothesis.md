Experiment 1: Do diets help lose more fat than exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Alt Hyp: % of test subjects that lost fat via diet is significantly higher than those who lose fat via exercise.

Null Hypothesis: % of test subjects that lose fat via diet is the same or lower than those who lose fat via exercise, significance level p=0.05


Experiment 2: Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

Alt Hyp: The average IQ of children of non-smokers is significantly higher than the average IQ of children of smokers

Null Hyp: The average IQ of children of non-smokers is the same or lower than the average IQ of children of smokers, significance level p=0.05


Experiment 3: Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

Alt Hyp: The % of population with diabetes is significantly higher in regions without access to quality food

Null Hyp: The % of population with diabetes is the same or lower in regions without access to quality food, significance level p=0.05
