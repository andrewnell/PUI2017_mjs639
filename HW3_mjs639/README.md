HW 3

Assignment 1

For assignment 1, I worked with Valeria after bootcamp. We parsed the information together, and determined what the final output should look like. Together, we were able to create plots (using the same seed so that they would be identicle) for 4 of the 5 distributions. The following day, while working together with a large group (Tarek, Davey, Valeria, Marium, Rebecca, and others), I received inspiration from Marium to try to work with the formula for the Gumbel distribution to use as my 5th. After working with some equations, I was able to plot the distribution. I offered guidance to some members of this group, who were mostly just starting Assignment 1, while I worked on Assignment 2. 

Assignment 2

Valeria and I read through the prompt for Assignment 2 while working together on Assignment 1. We determined the output needed, and then worked together alongside Kent to create a hypothesis, clean the data, and plot it. We had a lot of trouble plotting the data, and would love to spend some time going over plotting techniques. A major part of our trouble was determining whether to plot via pandas or via matplotlib. 

Assignment 3

I followed along closely to the lab in class, so this assignment did not take long. I cleaned up my hypothesis, formally showed the calculation of the z-test, and stated my rejection of the null hypothesis at the end.
