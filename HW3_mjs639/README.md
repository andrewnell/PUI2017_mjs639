HW 3

Assignment 1

For assignment 1, I worked with Valeria after bootcamp. We parsed the information together, and determined what the final output should look like. Together, we were able to create plots (using the same seed so that they would be identicle) for 4 of the 5 distributions. The following day, while working together with a large group (Tarek, Davey, Valeria, Mariam, Rebecca, and others), I received inspiration from Mariam to try to work with the formula for the Gumbel distribution to use as my 5th. After working with some equations, was able to plot the distribution. I offered guidance to some members of this group, who were mostly just starting Assignment 1, while I worked on Assignment 2

Assignment 2

Valeria and I read through the prompt for Assignment 2 while working together on Assignment 1. We detemrined the output, and from there I worked on it independently.
