# PUI HW 4-1
## Review of Citi Bike Hypothesis
## Yuwen Chang (ywc249)

a. Hypothesis formulation is appropriate.

b. Data managed for the need of analysis with necessary variables: gender, age.

- Could also take a look at potential outliers, like the one aged 117, and decide whether to keep it.

- Could add an error measurement to Fig 2.

c. Given your hypothesis, I would suggest using a Z-test.

- The data is non-parametric and unpaired.

- It allows testing for the difference of means between two samples.

# FBB data is neither parametric nor non-parametric. Tests are. Data may follow a distributiong (e,g. gaussian) in which case a parametric test is apprioriatem, or not, in which case you should use a non-parametric test. 

# FBB I also asked to give suggestions on how to improve the analysis
