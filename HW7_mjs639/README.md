HW 7

Assignment 1

For Assignment I worked with Valeria, Kent, and Tarek. We came together to finish the assignment from HW3, collectively determining that we should use a two-tailed t-Test for our analysis. We all collaborated on the write up on Authera.

I have uploaded a PDF of the write-up, along with a copy of the final notebook that we used. For reference, here is the link to the Authera page: https://www.authorea.com/users/175471/articles/210788-average-age-of-citi-bike-users-based-on-gender

We attached the iPython Notebook to both of our figures, and it worked properly at first. However, upon completion of the assignment, when we tried to access the notebook again by clicking the 'Code' button, we all received error messages. We tried uploading the notebook again, but nothing worked. As of this moment, we still receive the error message when clicking the 'Code' button. 

Assignment 2

I worked with Valeria on Assignment 2. We tidied up the SQL code we wrote in class last Thursday, and used the skeleton notebook provided to preview all of the queried datasets. I added screenshots of the maps we generated in class.
