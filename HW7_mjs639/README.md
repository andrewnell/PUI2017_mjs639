HW 7

For HW 7 I worked with Valeria, Kent, and Tarek. We came together to finish the assignment from HW3, collectively determining that we should use a two-tailed t-Test for our analysis. We all collaborated on the write up on Authera.

I have uploaded a PDF of the write-up, along with a copy of the final notebook that we used. For reference, here is the link to the Authera page: https://www.authorea.com/users/175471/articles/210788-average-age-of-citi-bike-users-based-on-gender
