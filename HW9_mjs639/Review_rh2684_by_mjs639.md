The plot is very easy to read, and readily expresses the data being represented. The axes labels are specific, and the legend is placed appropriately. The colors chosen for the regression line and scatterplot work well together, and are easy on the eyes. The use of red, which combines with blue to make purple, indirectly evokes a sense of water. Looking at your caption, I appreciate that you provided specific metrics to complement the visual. Though the plot speaks for itself, having the supplemental information made it easier to contextualize what the plot represents.

The one thing I would recommend changing would be to extend the y-axis to start a little closer to 0 so that we could see the true rate of decline over the years. The shortened axis currently paints the decrease in a visually dramatic way. Additionally, if this plot were being used to predict water consumption levels for the future, I would love to see the regression model extend beyond 2015, to showcase where our consumption levels will be in the near future. Lastly, though this is by no means a flaw in the plot, I as a viewer have a hard time conceptualizing billions of gallons. Perhaps it would be useful to provide a baseline for comparison!
