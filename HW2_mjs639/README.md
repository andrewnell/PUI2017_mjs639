For HW 2 I worked with Valeria, Davey, and Srikanth. 

Assignment 1 

For assignment one, I was able to shape the foundation of my script (sys, reading the url) by referencing various notebooks and scripts in the Lab folder. I was able to quickly access the MTA API, however it wasn't until Davey showed me that Firefox automatically formatted the data in an easy-to-navigate way that I was able to parse what I was looking at. 

Once the data was understandable, I figured out how to isolate each independent bus in the code (variable 'indbus'). This variable was crucial for the output of my script. I took the length of this variable to determine the number of active busses, and created a for-loop in order to pull the location of each bus within the list. I had a hard time getting the loop to properly print the desired output, but Srikanth was able to help me by showing me how to create a 'busno' counter. 

Assignment 2

Assignment 2 began similarly to Assignment 1 -- I was able to use a majority of the script I had previously written in order to kick-start the assignment. I identified the paths to the desired information ('stop' and 'status') and used these to determine the full spread of info for each bus. I knew I wanted to turn these data into a list to populate my dataframe, but had a hard time figuring out how.  Shrikanth helped me use my for loop to write the data to an empty list, which I was then able to use to populate my dataframe. Once the dataframe was populated, I was able to write it to a CSV file.
